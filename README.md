# Music_Project

This project has the aim to better understand a possible application of DNNs for Music tasks. The assignment was given for the "Machine Learning and Deep Learning" MSc course and the final project grade was 10/10. The project was conducted by a team of 3 students.
Main topics:
* **Developing a CRNN for Genre Classification** for GTZAN dataset. This includes several sub-tasks as data cleaning, data preprocessing, data augmentation etc.
* **Making some experiments** in the vanilla net and see the new results. One of our proposals was to increment the Dropout coefficient, gaining some improvements.
* **Suggesting an extension for the task**, that in our case was the "Mood Classification" application, in which a Pooling Layer was chosen instead of another.
